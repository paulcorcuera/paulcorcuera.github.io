## Introduction

This course is a continuation of Econ 626 and taught by professor [Vadim Marmer](https://economics.ubc.ca/profile/vadim-marmer/). There is a discussion of linear econometric models, and their identification and estimation. Nonlinear models are covered in the context of extremum estimation. The general theory of extremum estimators is also studied with the main focus on generic approaches to establishing their consistency and asymptotic normality. The course concludes with topics in model (variables) selection using machine learning (ML) LASSO-based approaches. While the majority of the ML literature is concerned with prediction, the focus is on estimation of structural effects.

##### Useful Readings

- [Davidson (1994)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/stochastic-limit-theory-9780192844507?cc=us&lang=en&) – This is an amazing textbook at the graduate level, which covers key concepts to understand large sample theory.
- [Hansen (2020)](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/papers/JoE_2020.pdf) – This paper applies the tools from time series theory to the case where there is cluster dependence. You will notice that using similar covariance inequality tools we can reach a central limit theorem with cluster dependence.
