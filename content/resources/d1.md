## Overview

Estimating variance components of high-dimensional fixed effects can be complex due to the fact that we're squaring estimation noise, and this noise can potentially be large due to limited mobility bias. I list some projects that develop procedures to deal with this problem. 

In a standard two-way fixed effect model based on [Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0262.00020) we have
$$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \Psi_{j(i,t)} + \varepsilon_{it} $$.

Under fixed regressors and exogenous mobility assumption, we still have the problem that a variance component of the firm effects is biased:
$$ E[\hat{\beta}'A\hat{\beta}] =  \beta' A\beta +  \sum_{i=1}^n B_{ii} \sigma_i^2 $$,

where $B_{ii} = x_i'S_{xx}^{-1}AS_{xx}^{-1}x_i$, and $A$ is either a positive semi-definite matrix (variance component) or a non-definite matrix (co-variance component).

The next section lists some useful packages that deal with this problem.

## Implementations

- [Pytwoway Package by Thibaut Lamadon (Python)](https://github.com/tlamadon/pytwoway) – This package includes every implementation of two-way fixed effects estimation of firm effects (exact bias correction, correlated random effects, among others).
- [LeaveOutTwoWay Package by Raffaele Saggio (Matlab)](https://github.com/rsaggio87/LeaveOutTwoWay) – This package implements the bias correction described in [Kline, Saggio, and Sølvsten](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA16410).
- [LeaveOutTwoWay Package by VSE HighDimensionalEconLab](https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl) – This package implements the bias correction described in [Kline, Saggio, and Sølvsten](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA16410). It also includes some intermediate functions that are useful for AKM models such as finding the largest connected set and the leave-one-out set as described in the paper. If you don't feel comfortable with learning one of these programming languages to implement this bias-correction, an executable is provided such that no software installation is needed.
